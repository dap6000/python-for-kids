    'Where conditionals let us say "Run my block of code if my condition is true" loops let us say "Run my block of code over and over".',
    'For loops work great with lists and ranges because those are both examples of iterators.',
    'An iterator is a collection of items with a pointer for the current iteam and a way to advance the pointer to the next item.',
    'Lists are an obvious example of an iterator but Python uses iterators in lots of other situations, such as reading a text file line by line.',
    'A for loop will run once for each item in its iterator and stop once the iterator runs out of items.',
    'If you don\'t have a list of items but instead want to repeat a certain number of times you can use the range() function to produce an iterator with the number of desired items.',
    'A while look has a condition much like an if statement. And it will repeat as long as its condition is true.',
    'Usually the code block inside a while loop will make some change that will eventually cause the condition of the while loop to be false. Otherwise you get an infinate loop.',
    'We can force an exit out of either a for or a while loop using break. When Python executes a break command it terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement after the loop.',
    'Python also has a continue statement that will stop execution of this pass through a loop and pick up with the next pass. The book doesn\'t cover continue statements until chapter 18.',
